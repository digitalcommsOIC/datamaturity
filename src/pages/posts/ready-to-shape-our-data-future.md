We’re excited to announce that our [data maturity assessment survey](https://datamaturity.dataorchard.org.uk/20-minute/sign-up/9caaec2a-fc00-4fb8-9b34-dae394f46ec8) is now live! We’re inviting everyone to participate and help shape our organisation’s journey towards smarter use of information.

<!-- Before you get started, here’s everything you need to know:   -->



## What You Need to Do
- **Set aside 20–30 minutes:** Grab a cuppa, make yourself comfortable, and give yourself enough time to complete the survey  
- **Use the right setup:** The survey is best completed on a computer or laptop (not a mobile or tablet) with a stable internet connection. Please use an up-to-date browser such as Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Safari, or Firefox
- **Complete it before the deadline:** We’d really appreciate it if you could finish the survey by **Friday 13 December**

## What’s the Survey About?
The data maturity assessment explores how our organisation uses and manages information. It covers seven key areas: Uses, Data, Analysis, Leadership, Culture, Tools, and Skills.  

We take a broad view of information, including everything from customer details and service engagement to financial records and performance metrics.  

## Tips for Completing the Survey
- Answer based on your perception of the overall organisation - not just your role or department
- There are no right or wrong answers - just respond as honestly as you can
- If you’re unsure about a question, don’t worry! There’s a “don’t know/not applicable” option

## What Happens Next?
1. Once you sign up, you’ll get a confirmation email with the subject: *‘Account sign up complete: Data Maturity Assessment’*
2. At the end of the survey, you’ll see an instant report showing how you personally scored the organisation, including strengths and weaknesses across the seven themes
3. After the survey closes, your responses will contribute anonymously to a whole-organisation report. This will help us identify improvement priorities and measure our progress going forward
